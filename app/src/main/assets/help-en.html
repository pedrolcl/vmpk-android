    <h1>VMPK for Android</h1>
    <p>Thank you for installing <a href="http://vmpk.sf.net">VMPK</a>
      for Android.</p>
    <p>This program is a MIDI Controller emulated by software. It
      produces MIDI events, which can be received by other compatible
      devices like MIDI Synthesizers to produce sound. The package you
      have installed already includes a MIDI Synthesizer, in addition to
      a mechanism for transmitting MIDI events by the network that can
      be received by computers connected to your local network, using
      either Ethernet or Wireless interfaces.</p>
    <p>To receive these MIDI events on a Windows PC or Mac OSX connected
      to the same local network as your Android device, install in the
      computer the software <a href="http://nerds.de/en/ipmidi.html">ipMIDI</a>
      gateway. In Linux you can use either <a
        href="http://llg.cubic.org/tools/multimidicast/">multimidicast</a>
      or <a href="http://qmidiio.github.pedrolcl.net">Qmidinet</a>. You
      may need to disable or reconfigure the Firewall in your computer
      to allow these programs to work properly.</p>
    <p>VMPK does not record songs or reproduce recordings. To record,
      edit and play MIDI compositions you need a MIDI Sequencer, which
      is a different&nbsp; type of MIDI Software.</p>
    <h2>Main features</h2>
    <p>In the first row of the screen you can find a bar with 5 buttons,
      selecting the features shown in the row immediately below. These
      are the usual controls of any MIDI controller keyboard, with some
      particularities.</p>
    <p>Some sliders can change its value using the device's tilt sensor
      (accelerometer/gyroscope). This feature is activated by the switches
      labeled "Gyro".</p>
    <p>The piano keyboard initially shows 2 octaves, but there is an
      option in the Settings page to select any number of keys. By
      selecting a larger number, the size of the keys becomes smaller
      enough to fit the whole keyboard onto the screen.</p>
    <p>You can press simultaneously as much keys as the number of your
      device simultaneous touch points.</p>
    <p>The program's menu is available where you usually find it on the
      Android apps. The "Show note names" option activates tags over the
      piano keys displaying the names of the notes and their octave
      numbers. The "Settings" menu option opens a configuration page
      where you can change several options. The "Full screen" option
      hides all controls and text except the piano keyboard, so you can
      focus in your music without distractions.</p>
    <p>The main volume of the synthesizer can be changed using the
      standard operating system functions.</p>
    <p><em>It is recommended to use headphones to avoid disturbing
        others nearby</em>.</p>
    <h2>Settings</h2>
    <h3>Piano Settings</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Number of Piano Keys: any value between 12 and 49. By
          default, the keyboard displays 25 keys.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>First Key: any natural note between C and B. By default, the
          starting note is C.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Key Pressed Color: you may choose any color among many ones
          available.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>MIDI Output: by default, VMPK sends MIDI events to the
          internal synthesizer, but it can also send MIDI events to
          external devices, using your device's WiFi radio.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Double Keyboard in Full Screen: when the Full Screen mode is
          activated there can be two keyboards. The lower one is exactly
          like the upper (same number of keys, same starting note) but
          plays the lower octaves.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Program Settings</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Language: you can choose from Spanish and English
          translations of the program texts.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Theme: you can choose from a dark and a light theme. The dark
          theme uses less power than the light one, enabling longer
          battery life.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Internal MIDI Synthesizer Settings</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Reverb: There are four available presets for reverberation,
          and the option to switch it off entirely.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Chorus: There are four available presets for chorus, and the
          option to switch it off entirely.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Network-UDP Multicast (IPMIDI)</h3>
    <p>You should use these values unchanged, unless you configure the
      software in your computers in the same way as well.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Port number: by default, ipMIDI uses the port number 21928</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Multicast address: by default the ipMIDI address is
          255.0.0.37</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
